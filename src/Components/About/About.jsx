      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <strong>I am a software engineer with experience in full stack web development. I have learned in my previous career as a chef and currently as a full stack software engineer to quickly adopt new methodologies, technologies, and best practices to fit the current needs of the team. I switched from Culinary Arts to Software Development to pursue a life-long love of technology and continue my passion for learning and growth. I am excited to expand my knowledge and collaborate in a fast-paced, growth-driven Agile environment that prioritizes clean, scalable, and maintainable code and with a team that is passionate about adopting new technologies to grow as developers and provide better user experience.
